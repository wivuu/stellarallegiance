## Simulation & Physics

### Flight Model
Core deterministic physics system shared between server and client for ship movement, thrust, and rotation.
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:** 
  - `shared/FlightModel.cs` — deterministic physics (shared across server/client)
  - `client/scripts/PredictionController.cs` — client-side input prediction and reconciliation
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — authoritative server simulation loop (20 Hz tick)
- **Related:** [[SimTick]], [[Held-Input Replay]]
- **Notes:** Server is single source of truth; client predicts and reconciles against server snapshots

### SimTick
Server's authoritative 20 Hz simulation loop that drives all gameplay state updates.
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — main loop tick handler
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Pig.cs` — pig brain decision integration
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — snapshot quantization and transmission
- **Related:** [[Flight Model]], [[PigBrain]]
- **Notes:** Never blocks on network I/O; runs deterministically regardless of client connections

### Held-Input Replay
Client technique for smoothing input predictions: store held inputs, replay against server state deltas, avoid jitter when server corrects position.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/PredictionController.cs` — input history buffer and replay logic
  - `shared/FlightModel.cs` — deterministic replay against consistent physics
- **Related:** [[Flight Model]], [[Client Prediction]]
- **Notes:** Prevents popcorn/jitter when client overshoots and server corrects

### AOI (Area of Interest)
Distance-based visibility culling: server only streams entities within fixed distance tiers from each client.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Sim/World.cs` — entity spatial indexing
  - `server/Net/ClientHub.cs` — per-client entity interest filtering
  - `shared/Defs.cs` — AOI radius constants (SIM_*_RADIUS tuning)
- **Related:** [[Snapshot]], [[Spatial Grid]]
- **Notes:** Fixed nearest-60 replaced by distance tiers + environment knobs (SIM_NEAR_RADIUS, SIM_FAR_RADIUS, SIM_FAR_EVERY)

---

## Weapons & Combat

### Missile
Guided projectile with seekers, can lock targets, detonate via proximity or time-out.
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/Missile.cs` — missile data model
  - `client/scripts/MissileView.cs` — client-side missile rendering
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — MsgMissiles message separate from ship snapshots
- **Related:** [[Seeker]], [[Chaff]], [[Blast Radius]]
- **Notes:** Proto v15: MsgMissiles separate stride (never extend MsgSnapshot records); author racks AFTER guns for barrel-seed alignment

### Seeker
Guidance system that locks onto and tracks targets; disrupted by chaff clouds.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/Missile.cs` — seeker behavior/accuracy
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — ResolveSeekerTarget logic (chaff substitution seam)
- **Related:** [[Missile]], [[Chaff]], [[Target Lock]]
- **Notes:** ResolveSeekerTarget checks chaff clouds; seekers can be spoofed

### Chaff
Expendable sensor-decoy puff a ship ejects (key `C`); a seeker rolls a stateless hash
(`ChaffStrength` vs the missile's `ChaffResistance`) to break its lock and home on the puff.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/Chaff.cs` — chaff model (ChaffStrength, DecoyRadius)
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Chaff.cs` — ChaffSim + TryDropChaff/StepChaff/TryChaffAim (Track A fills)
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — `MsgChaff=15` one-shot spawn broadcast (28 B); dispenser WeaponDef (Chaff kind)
  - `client/scripts/ChaffFx.cs` — client puff sprites (Track A fills)
- **Related:** [[Missile]], [[Seeker]], [[Expendables]], [[Minefield]]
- **Notes:** Proto v18: chaff is a launcher-projected `WeaponKind.Chaff` WeaponDef linked to its cargo item
  by `CargoId`; ammo comes from spawn cargo counts, not a rack; TryChaffAim is the D5 substitution seam

### Minefield
A deployed cloud of proximity mines (key `B`): one deploy scatters `MineCloudCount` mines within
`MineCloudRadius`, arms after `MineArmTicks`, then each triggers an enemy within `MineTriggerRadius`
for a `BlastPower`/`BlastRadius` splash; the field depletes mine-by-mine.
- **Frequency:** Domain-specific
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/Mine.cs` — mine model (CloudRadius/CloudCount/ArmDelay/BlastRadius)
  - `shared/MinefieldLayout.cs` — splitmix64 seed→cloud offsets, shared by sim/client/tests
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Mines.cs` — MineFieldSim + TryDeployMine/StepMines (Track B fills)
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — `MsgMinefields=13` (41-B seed records, per anchor sector) + `MsgMineGone=14`
  - `client/scripts/MinefieldViews.cs` — client sprite clouds (Track B fills)
- **Related:** [[Chaff]], [[Blast Radius]], [[Expendables]]
- **Notes:** Proto v18: seed-based wire (client regenerates offsets); `aliveMask` (CloudCount ≤ 64) self-heals a resync

### Fog of War (Team Vision)
Server-authoritative per-team vision: undiscovered map data never reaches the client. Ships/bases/
probes contribute a directional cone (occluded by asteroids) and/or an omnidirectional proximity
sphere, both scaled by the target's `RadarSignature`; an outer "eyeball" tier streams a ship's mesh
without radar/HUD detection. Computed at 2 Hz on a dedicated worker thread, pipelined one interval
deep so the applied timeline is tick-deterministic regardless of worker speed. Enemy ships lost from
view persist as last-known "ghost" contacts (HUD/radar only) until re-scouted or re-spotted.
- **Frequency:** Core (fog-of-war on by default)
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Vision.cs` — `TeamVision`, the 2 Hz snapshot-in/apply-at-boundary worker, `IsPointVisibleToTeam`
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — `MsgReveal=16` (newly-scouted statics), `MsgContacts=17` (ghosts + radar-id list)
  - `client/scripts/WorldRenderer.cs` — `GhostContacts`, `NetSetContacts`; `TargetMarkers.cs` — dim ghost glyphs
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Pig.cs` / missile lock gating — PIGs and lock acquisition respect team vision
- **Related:** [[Recon Probe]], [[Threat Lock (being-locked warning)]]
- **Notes:** Per-server world-YAML knob `fog-of-war` (default on); off ⇒ behavior/bytes identical to pre-fog

### Per-Sector Environment (God Rays / Nebula / Dust Clouds)
Optional `environment:` block on each sector in a map YAML, driving that sector's look AND — for dust —
its gameplay. Four sub-blocks, all optional (an omitted block keeps the legacy default): `sun`
(azimuth/elevation + color + energy + `god-rays` strength), `nebula` (color/intensity/seed override of
the client's procedural backdrop), `belt` (per-sector asteroid field/belt shape — **server-only**, the
client already receives concrete rocks), and `dust`. **Dust clouds** are procedurally *distributed*
(YAML sets count/size/coverage/density/color + attenuation; the server seeds the actual clouds
deterministically on a dedicated RNG so they never perturb asteroid/aleph placement). Sun/nebula/dust
stream to the client per sector; the client renders each dust cloud as a **3D entity** — a `MultiMesh`
of soft billboard "puffs" (one MultiMesh per cloud) whose puffs are placed along a **ridged fractal-noise
(fbm) field ported from the nebula sky shader** (Starscape.cs), so a cloud clumps into wispy filaments
rather than a round ball. A custom billboard shader adds per-puff **fbm noise** (cloudy internal texture)
and reads the per-instance colour; each puff gets a two-tone **colour variation** plus **sun shading
baked in** (sun-facing side of the cloud bright, far side in shadow — the sector sun is static). It
**never touches Godot's volumetric fog** (an earlier global-fog + `FogVolume` attempt tinted every
ship/asteroid instead of drawing clouds and was removed). **God rays** are a **screen-space crepuscular
pass** (`GodRayShaderCode`) on a CanvasLayer below the HUD: it smears the bright sun + sunlit dust into
shafts and only amplifies already-bright pixels, so it never flat-tints geometry; driven by
`sun.god-rays`.
- **Frequency:** Core (map-authored; stock map "Brimstone Gambit" ships env blocks)
- **Gameplay:** A dust cloud on the viewer→target sightline **shrinks radar/vision range** via
  `dust.vision-mult` — the effective sphere/cone/eyeball radius is multiplied by an optical-depth factor
  in `ClassifyTarget` + `IsPointVisibleToTeam` + `TeamStillSeesShipLive`. Fog-off never runs this path
  (byte-identical). New vision-range modifiers must fold into all three, like signature.
- **Key Files:**
  - `shared/Defs.cs` — `SectorEnvironment`/`SectorSun`/`SectorNebula`/`SectorBelt`/`SectorDust` on `WorldSectorConfig.Env`
  - `server/Content/MapLoader.cs` — YAML DTOs + `ProjectEnv`; `server/Content/maps/brimstone-gambit.yaml` — reference
  - `server/Sim/World.cs` — `DustCloud`/`DustClouds`, `SeedDustClouds` (own RNG), belt overrides threaded into `SeedAsteroid*`
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Vision.cs` — `DustVisionMult`/`SegmentSphereChord`, `_dustClouds`/`_dustFloor` cache
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — `WriteSectorEnv` appended to `WriteSectorStatic` (Welcome + `MsgReveal`); proto v25
  - `client/scripts/SectorEnvironment.cs` — sun + 3D dust (`MultiMesh` fractal billboard puffs, custom shader: noise + colour variation + baked sun shading) + screen-space god rays; `Starscape.cs` — nebula override
  - `client/scripts/WorldRenderer.cs` — `ApplySectorEnv` seam (routes every sector transition)
- **Related:** [[Fog of War (Team Vision)]], [[YAML Content Pipeline]], [[MsgWelcome]]
- **Notes:** Belt tuning is server-only; only sun/nebula/dust-visual + the seeded cloud list ride the wire

### Recon Probe
Deployable, invulnerable, stationary sensor buoy (key `G`): one deploy spends a probe-cargo charge
and drops a probe just ahead of the ship, granting its team an unoccluded vision sphere
(`ProbeSightRadius`) until it expires after `ProbeLifespanSec`. Streams only to the owning team.
- **Frequency:** Domain-specific
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/Probe.cs` — probe model (SightRadius/Lifespan/ModelName)
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Probes.cs` — `ProbeSim` + `TryDeployProbe`/`StepProbes`; feeds an extra unoccluded
    sphere viewer into `Simulation.Vision.cs`'s `CaptureVisionInput` (no new worker code path)
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — `MsgProbes=18` (owner-team-only, minefield-style cadence), `MsgProbeGone=19`
  - `client/scripts/ProbeView.cs` — stationary GLB visual (`assets/probes/<ModelName>.glb`), team-tinted fallback
- **Related:** [[Fog of War (Team Vision)]], [[Minefield]], [[Chaff]], [[Expendables]]
- **Notes:** Proto v23: `WeaponKind.Probe` dispenser, ammo/cadence rides the same D6/D9 seam as chaff/mine

### Threat Lock (being-locked warning)
Warning that an enemy missile-armed ship is locking you: `ShipSim.ThreatLockState` (0 none / 1 locking /
2 locked) rides free bits in the snapshot flags byte (`ShipFlagLockingMe=4`, `ShipFlagLockedMe=8`).
- **Frequency:** Domain-specific
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — per-tick ThreatLockState reset before Pass A; UpdateLock raises it (Track A)
  - `client/scripts/GameNetClient.cs` — decodes flags → `Ship.ThreatLock` / `LocalThreatLock`
- **Related:** [[Target Lock]], [[Missile]]

### Dock Refund
Voluntary dock at your own base refunds the ship's `PaidCost` to team credits (relaunch pays again →
net-free rearm/repair); death refunds nothing (pods don't inherit PaidCost).
- **Frequency:** Domain-specific
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — `ShipSim.PaidCost` set in SpawnCombatShip; DockShip refunds (Track A)
- **Related:** [[Hull]], [[Payload]]

### Shield
Regenerating energy layer over the raw-health model, authored per hull/faction (`shield-capacity`,
`shield-recharge` points/sec, `shield-delay` seconds). Absorbs incoming damage before the hull;
overflow from a shield-popping hit spills into the hull the same tick; recharges after the quiet
delay. A per-weapon `shield-damage-multiplier` (default 1.0) is the damage-type interaction.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Hull.cs` — `ShieldCapacity/ShieldRecharge/ShieldDelay`; `Model/Parts/Part.cs` — `ShieldDamageMultiplier`
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — `ApplyDamage` (single damage seam for all 7 sites), spawn init, end-of-Step recharge sweep, `ShieldsEnabled` test toggle
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — shield f16 in the ship snapshot (ShipRecordSize 55) + 3 shield floats/1 shieldMult in MsgDefs (proto 19)
  - `client/scripts/SystemRing.cs` — cyan SHLD solid arc wrapping the HULL gauge; `client/scripts/ShieldFlash.cs` — hemisphere hit flash
- **Related:** [[Hull]], [[Blast Radius]], [[Direct Hit Multiplier]]
- **Notes:** Proto v19; a pod uses the Pod def's shield (0). `ShieldsEnabled=false` lets damage-mechanic tests isolate raw damage. `tests/ShieldTest` is the determinism guard.

### Blast Radius
Damage falloff zone around explosion epicenter; damps based on distance and intervening obstacles.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/Missile.cs` — blast_radius, blast_power fields
  - `server/Sim/World.cs` — collision query and damage propagation
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — blast resolution
- **Related:** [[Missile]], [[Direct Hit Multiplier]]

  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/Missile.cs` — direct_hit_multiplier field
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — impact detection and damage scaling
- **Related:** [[Blast Radius]], [[Missile]]
- **Notes:** Scales all projectile damage (ballistic + guided); tuned in YAML

### Projectile
Client-side synthetic representation of ballistic fire (bolts, cannon rounds); never stored server-side.
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/ProjectileView.cs` — render and interpolation
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — ShotResolution message encodes hit position/time
  - `shared/Defs.cs` — projectile speed/lifetime constants
- **Related:** [[ShotResolution]], [[Client-Side Hit Sparks]]
- **Notes:** Phase 0: no Projectile table; client synthesizes bolts; server drains ShotResolution messages; Phase 1 = native sim server with server-side ballistic tracking

### ShotResolution
Server message reporting ballistic projectile hits: target ship ID, impact position, time offset.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — MsgShotResolution structure
  - `client/scripts/ProjectileView.cs` — consumes resolutions to spawn hit effects
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — ballistic hit detection logic
- **Related:** [[Projectile]], [[Client-Side Hit Sparks]]
- **Notes:** Separate batch drained per SimTick; allows client to render bolts and confirm hits

## Content Pipeline & Game Data

### YAML Content Pipeline
Server-driven content authoring: gameplay/balance values (hulls, weapons, techs, factions) live in YAML files, compiled to binary defs, streamed to clients at runtime.

### World Tuning Blocks
Server-side sim tuning authored in the standalone `server/Content/core/world.yaml` (NOT part of the factions bundle manifest; loaded by `WorldLoader`, overridable via `SIM_WORLD`/`--world`) — `ai:` (PIG drone difficulty/behavior), `combat:` (collision damage + boundary hazard), `mechanics:` (gates/docking/pods/economy/match flow), `seeding:` (asteroid field/belt shapes + base placement), plus root `aleph-radar-signature`/`rock-radar-signature`. Every key optional; omitted keys keep stock values (the shared classes' field initializers). NEVER streamed — no protocol impact.
- **Frequency:** Common (any sim-balance sweep)
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Content/core/world.yaml` — authored values (stock = documented defaults); standalone, not a manifest fragment
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/RuntimeData.cs` — AiTuning/CombatTuning/MechanicsTuning/SeedingTuning records (nullable = "unauthored")
  - `shared/Defs.cs` — WorldAiTuning/WorldCombatTuning/WorldMechanicsTuning/WorldSeedingTuning (initializers = stock)
  - `server/Content/WorldLoader.cs` — WorldDef DTOs + Load/Project override-or-stock resolve
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Pig.cs` — InitPigTuning (seconds→ticks conversion)
- **Related:** [[YAML Content Pipeline]], [[PigBrain]], [[WorldConfig]]

- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Parts/Payload.cs` — payload model
  - `server/Content/core/*.yaml` — payload definitions
  - `client/scripts/LoadoutController.cs` — loadout UI
- **Related:** [[Hull]], [[Missile]], [[Chaff]], [[Expendables]]

- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Expendables/` — all expendable types
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — expendable consumption and effect logic
- **Related:** [[Missile]], [[Chaff]], [[Payload]]
- **Notes:** Ammo tied to player ship; respawn restocks loadout

- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Content/core/*.yaml` — tech tree structure
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Resolution/TechResolver.cs` — tech unlock logic
  - `shared/Defs.cs` — tech table registry
- **Related:** [[YAML Content Pipeline]], [[Def]], [[Hull]], [[Weapon]]

- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `shared/WireQuant.cs` — f16 encoding/decoding
  - `server/Net/Protocol.cs` — applied to position/velocity in MsgSnapshot
- **Related:** [[MsgSnapshot]], [[Protocol]]

### DIRECT-FIRST
Reachability probe strategy: attempt direct P2P connection first; only fall back to relay if P2P fails.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `public-lobby/ReachabilityProbe.cs` — STUN probing logic
  - `public-lobby/Signaling.cs` — fallback routing
  - `server/Net/WebRtcListener.cs` — direct accept handling
- **Related:** [[WebRTC]], [[Public Lobby]]
- **Notes:** NO TURN server; reintroducing TURN would add latency and cost

- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Net/ClientHub.cs` — reconnect token validation and ship reclaim
  - `client/scripts/GameNetClient.cs` — reconnect logic
  - `server/Net/Lobby.cs` — ship state caching

- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `shared/Collision/SimModel.cs` — hull + docking geometry
  - `server/Assets/SimAssets.cs` — cached .simmodel loading
  - `shared/Collision/ConvexHull.cs` — QuickHull hull generation
- **Related:** [[GLB]], [[Collision]], [[Hull]]

- **Related:** [[UI Components]], [[UiKit]], [[Theme]]
- **Notes:** Applied per-overlay (not globally); ChamferButton and all UI elements derive from tokens

### UI Components
Reusable Godot .NET UI controls: ChamferButton, BracketPanel, ModalHost, SettingsDialog, etc.
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/ui/` — all component classes
  - `client/scripts/ui/ChamferButton.cs` — custom-draw retro button
  - `client/scripts/ui/ModalHost.cs` — overlay layer manager
  - `client/scenes/UiShowcase.tscn` — live gallery (F9 in-game)
- **Related:** [[DesignTokens]], [[DESIGN.md]], [[UiKit]]
- **Notes:** Never hardcode colors/fonts; derive from DesignTokens; add new components to UiShowcase.tscn

### UiKit
Static factory helper for stock UI controls: `MakeButton`, `MakeSlider`, `MakeToggle`, etc.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/ui/UiKit.cs` — factory methods
- **Related:** [[UI Components]], [[DesignTokens]]
- **Notes:** Use `UiKit.MakeLabel(text, TextStyle, color?)` instead of setting fonts by hand

### ModalHost
Overlay layer manager: manages z-order for menus, dialogs, settings.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/ui/ModalHost.cs` — layer orchestration
  - `client/scripts/ui/SettingsDialog.cs` — settings UI
  - `client/scripts/ui/EscapeMenu.cs` — escape menu
- **Related:** [[UI Components]], [[DesignTokens]]
- **Notes:** Layer 200 for modals; SettingsDialog uses live write-through + snapshot revert

### Theme
Per-overlay Godot UI theme application; not global.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/ui/DesignTokens.cs` — theme wiring
  - `DESIGN.md` — theme application rules
- **Related:** [[DesignTokens]], [[UI Components]]
- **Notes:** Call `UiTheme.Apply(control)` on each full-screen overlay root; cannot live on CanvasLayer

### Zoom Mode (Telescopic Scope)
Circular picture-in-picture magnifier centred on screen: a second Camera3D renders the live world (shared World3D, narrow FOV) into a SubViewport, drawn clipped to a disc in place of the SystemRing gauges. `+`/`KpAdd` opens at 5x and steps 5→10→20 (capped); `−`/`KpSubtract` steps down and closes below 5x; Esc dismisses. Mouse-look sensitivity is divided by the magnification for fine aim.
- **Frequency:** Occasional
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/ZoomView.cs` — the scope (SubViewport + narrow-FOV camera, circular draw, input, `Active`/`Magnification` statics)
  - `client/scripts/Hud.cs` — instantiates it after WeaponsPanel
  - `client/scripts/SystemRing.cs` / `VelocityIndicator.cs` / `TargetMarkers.cs` — hidden while `ZoomView.Active`
  - `client/scripts/ShipController.cs` — Esc bail-out + mouse gain ÷ `ZoomView.Magnification`
- **Related:** [[UI Components]], [[DesignTokens]]
- **Notes:** Scope FOV = 2·atan(tan(75°/2)/M); shares the main World3D (split-screen idiom), never OwnWorld3D (that's the hangar preview)

### First-Person View (Cockpit Camera)
The chase camera's two-mode state machine: THIRD PERSON (the behind-the-ship chase shot) and FIRST PERSON (the pilot's eye, parked at the hull's `Cockpit` hardpoint). Both framings share the ship's basis, so switching is a purely positional, smoothstep-eased dolly (~0.3 s) between the chase offset and the cockpit offset — never a hard cut. First person is the DEFAULT, persisted per player (`UserPrefs.FirstPersonView`, default true). `V` toggles modes without touching the zoom; winding the wheel IN past the closest chase shot dives into the cockpit, winding OUT of the cockpit pulls back to the tightest chase framing. The own hull / team-trail / engine-glow / own-nameplate hide only once the transition completes (`CameraRig.FirstPersonActive`), so the ship stays visible throughout the dolly.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `client/scripts/CameraRig.cs` — the view-mode state machine, `V` toggle, wheel transitions, cockpit-offset lookup, `FirstPersonActive`/`ViewIsFirstPerson` statics, `--view-demo` self-drive
  - `client/scripts/PredictionController.cs` — hides the own ShipModel/TeamTrail/glow/nameplate while `FirstPersonActive && !SectorOverview.Active`
  - `client/scripts/EngineGlow.cs` — `Suppressed` flag folded into the per-frame `Visible` recompute
  - `client/scripts/ViewModeIndicator.cs` — transient "VIEW FPV/3RD" chip flashed on a toggle
  - `client/scripts/UserPrefs.cs` — `FirstPersonView` persisted pref
  - `server/Content/core/hulls.yaml` — the `kind: cockpit` hardpoint (eye point) on each hull
- **Related:** [[Zoom Mode (Telescopic Scope)]], [[Hardpoint]], [[UserPrefs]]
- **Notes:** `Cockpit` = `HardpointKind` byte 8 (append-only, client-only — no wire/sim change); marker `HP_Cockpit_0` resolved to ship-local space, fallback `(0, 0.5, 1)`; F3 sector overview un-hides the own ship

## Server Architecture

### Lobby
In-game social state: player roster, team assignment, ready status, faction selection.
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Net/Lobby.cs` — lobby state and player management
  - `server/Net/LobbyRegistrar.cs` — multi-lobby registry
  - `client/scripts/Lobby.cs` — client-side lobby UI
- **Related:** [[Team]], [[Faction]], [[Ready State]]
- **Notes:** Server-hosted; no external DB; team/ready state replicated to all clients

### Team
Player faction assignment: team 0 (Faction0, blue) or team 1 (Faction1, red).
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Net/Lobby.cs` — team assignment logic
  - `shared/Defs.cs` — team constant definitions
  - `client/scripts/ui/DesignTokens.cs` — faction color mapping
- **Related:** [[Faction]], [[Join Token]]
- **Notes:** Immutable after game start; faction colors are Faction0 (blue) / Faction1 (red); TeamAccent (cyan) is chrome only

### Faction
Gameplay variant: faction-specific hulls, weapons, techs. Loaded from YAML at server boot.
- **Frequency:** Very common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Content/core/*.yaml` — all faction content
  - `server/Content/FactionStart.cs` — faction startup
  - `factions/src/Allegiance.Factions/Model/Factions/Faction.cs` — faction model
- **Related:** [[YAML Content Pipeline]], [[Tech Tree]], [[Hull]]
- **Notes:** Immutable after boot; factions are defs; team assignment determines which faction player uses

### Ready State
Player signal that they are prepared for match: used for team-balanced start conditions.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Net/Lobby.cs` — ready flag and state machine
  - `client/scripts/Lobby.cs` — ready toggle UI
- **Related:** [[Team]], [[Lobby]]
- **Notes:** Server gates match start until all players ready

### PigBrain
Server-side AI decision system: 5 Hz decision tick, evaluates targets/actions, steers cached decisions.
- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.Pig.cs` — PigBrainTick and decision logic
  - `server/Sim/PigDecision.cs` — steering action encoding
  - `server/Sim/Simulation.cs` — decision caching and re-steering
- **Related:** [[SimTick]], [[Flight Model]]
- **Notes:** Decoupled from SimTick (20 Hz vs 5 Hz); PigBrainTick evaluates fresh targets; SimTick re-steers from cache; safe to hot-swap scheduled table

- **Frequency:** Domain-specific
- **Key Files:**
  - `tests/FlightModelTest/` — test suite
  - `shared/FlightModel.cs` — golden reference
- **Related:** [[Flight Model]]
- **Notes:** All tests pass as of 2026-06-12; any failure is a real regression

- **Frequency:** Common
- **Key Files:**
  - `shared/ContentValidator.cs` — validation logic
  - `server/Content/ContentLoader.cs` — pre-boot checks
- **Related:** [[YAML Content Pipeline]], [[Def]]

## Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

### STDB SQL Limitations
SpacetimeDB `sql` command has no ORDER BY; aggregates need explicit aliases.
- **Fix:** Cache keys in memory using commutative (XOR/sum) hashes, not order-dependent FNV
- **Key File:** `shared/Stdb/` — queries

### Iter() Order Instability
Iteration order over STDB tables is unstable across runs.
- **Fix:** Use commutative aggregation (XOR/sum) for cache keys; never rely on sequential order
- **Key File:** Various query loops

### Client No Baked Tuning Fallback
Client reads tuning only from subscribed def tables; no compile-time constant fallback.
- **Fix:** Guard (hold authority) until a def loads; never hardcode gameplay values
- **Key File:** `client/scripts/DefRegistry.cs`

### WorldConfig Cube-Law Asteroid Bloat
Asteroid count balloons with `WorldConfig` cube-law; O(entities×asteroids) collision pass.
- **Fix:** Route through per-sector spatial grid; see [[Asteroid Grid Broad-Phase]]
- **Key File:** `server/Sim/World.cs`

### SubViewport UI Gotchas
SubViewport needs explicit `World3D` for raycasts; SetAnchorsAndOffsetsPreset for code-built overlays.
- **Fix:** Assign a new World3D to each SubViewport; use preset helpers
- **Key File:** `client/scripts/ui/ModalHost.cs`

### Godot GLB Import Cache
Godot 4.6 requires explicit import of .glb files or silently falls back to engine font/placeholder.
- **Fix:** Run `godot --headless --import` after pulling new assets or changing .glb
- **Key File:** Build/CI workflows
