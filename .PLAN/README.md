## Prototype (COMPLETE)

The two-ship prototype (T0-T10) and post-prototype polish are **finished**.
Archives:

- `prototype-archive/00-09, 99` — original prototype plan documents
- `prototype-archive/10-POST-PROTOTYPE-DONE.md` — completed polish & PIGs
- `docs/PROTOTYPE-ARCHITECTURE.md` — consolidated architecture reference

---

## QUICKNOTES:
- **[M]** Code cleanup and refactor
- Faction name "Iron Coalition" is streamed but never displayed.
- Make gun and missile weapon mounts not compatible with all gun and missiles (explore configuration style options in YAML)
- Booster fuel needed, interceptor starting fuel too low, and we need the ability to add additional fuel to cargo that can load when we run out
- hulls.yaml:264-266 comment wrongly claims collision is purely ShipRadius — ship-vs-ship uses the full model-length hull, so the Devastator body-blocks on its ~20u silhouette.

## Content philosophy (the through-line)

**All content and mechanics tuning is server-authored data, downloaded by the client — never
baked into the client.** A game server defines what exists (ships, weapons, bases, factions, tech,
costs, mechanics knobs); clients receive it and render/predict from it. This is already half-true:
the def set streams server→client over `MsgDefs` and the client keeps **no** compile-time tuning
fallback. The roadmap closes the rest of the gap so an operator can **override content per server,
and eventually add an entire faction, with no client patch**:

1. **Single-source defs in code** — ✅ done (Stage 0).
2. **YAML authoring + per-server override** — defs come from editable YAML the server loads at
   startup, not C# (Stage 1). **The authoring schema is the in-repo `Allegiance.Factions` `Core`
   model** (`factions/`): one data layer — shared buyable catalog + factions + tech/capability
   gating — that the server loads, validates, and *projects* into the runtime def stream, so Stage
   2/4 (unlock gating, tech tree, factions) extend the same model instead of a parallel one.
3. **Runtime asset streaming** — the client downloads *binary* assets (meshes/textures/audio) it
   lacks from the game server to temp storage, so server-defined factions need no client install (Stage 4).

Corollary for sequencing: **the content pipeline lands before we author much new content**, so
missiles, tech, and factions are written as YAML data from the start, never as C# to be migrated.

---

## Roadmap (re-sequenced by dependency — 2026-06-27)

> **Why this order.** Each feature lands *after* the foundation that should own it; each
> foundation is built **minimally first, enriched later**; and all content is authored as
> **server-side data + behavior modules**, never hardcoded and rebuilt. The worries that drove the
> sequencing, and how the code resolves them:
>
> 1. **Missiles before a tech tree → hardcoding?** The real risk was the *bolt-only weapon
>    behavior* + the *sim's duplicate stat tables*, **not** the tree — fixed in Stage 0. The tree
>    only gates *availability* (Stage 4).
> 2. **Tech tree before a commander → who researches?** Research needs an *authority + money + a
>    gating hook*, not necessarily a commander. Bootstrap simple (Stage 2); commander in Stage 4.
>    **No accounts required** — the strategy layer is independent of the persistence track.
> 3. **Buy things without a rich UI?** The in-match **spawn menu is the buy-menu seam**; the "rich
>    UI" is the commander map (Stage 4).
> 4. **Author content without recompiling / patching clients?** Content is YAML on the server
>    (Stage 1), streamed to clients; new *assets* stream too (Stage 4). See *Content philosophy*.
>
> **Dependency spine:** single-source defs → **YAML content pipeline (per-server override)** →
> per-team state + money + unlock gating + buy menu → combat content → tech + commander + mining
> (+ **asset streaming** for client-patchless factions) → accounts/persistence *(independent)*.

### Phase 1 — Configurability & maintainability refactor — ✅ DONE

Tuning and content are data, not code, so new ships, weapons, and bases are config.

- ✅ **Data-driven ship classes & loadouts** — weapon/tuning constants lifted out of `Lib.cs`
  into runtime-configurable class + loadout defs (`DefRegistry`); weapon/ship/base logic split
  into focused modules.
- ✅ **Ship meshes & hardpoints** — `ShipModelLoader` reads GLBs carrying `HP_` hardpoint nodes.
  The `tools/ship-gen` pipeline builds modular GLBs from YAML.
- ✅ **Base meshes & hardpoints** — `BaseModelLoader` reads base models with docking, lighting,
  and exit hardpoints.
- ✅ **(bonus) Shared collision** — the convex-hull collision core (`ConvexHull`, GLB parser,
  `SimModel`, sphere-vs-hull response + dock-disc carve-out) lives in `shared/Collision/`; the
  server reads GLBs from disk and the **client builds the same hulls from its `res://` GLB bytes**,
  so the client *predicts* collision response identically (no penetrate-then-snap) and collision
  audio is hull-accurate. Damage stays server-authoritative.

### Stage 0 — Data-driven cleanup — ✅ DONE (2026-06-27)

Finishes what Phase 1 started: removes the *remaining* hardcoding and lays the weapon seam, so
everything downstream is authored as data + a behavior module rather than rebuilt later.

- ✅ **Single-source stat tables** — the sim no longer keeps private `Weapons[]` / `MaxHull()` /
  `PodMaxHull` duplicates of the authored defs. It resolves a ship's gun by its Weapon
  hardpoint's `WeaponId` (carried on `Muzzle`) and its spawn hull from the class def, via
  `WeaponDefs`/`ShipDefs`/`HullFor`/`PrimaryWeapon` built straight from `GameContent`
  (`server/Sim/Simulation.cs`, `Simulation.Pig.cs`). One source of truth; no drift.
- ✅ **Weapon behavior-type seam** — `WeaponKind : byte { Bolt }` (append-only) + `WeaponDef.Kind`
  (`shared/Defs.cs`); `TryFire` dispatches on kind (one branch today). Per-`WeaponId` muzzles let a
  hull mix weapons later. **Server-only — not on the wire** until a kind needs distinct client
  rendering (Stage 3), so no protocol bump.
- ✅ **Guard test** — `FlightModelTest` asserts every weapon-hardpoint `WeaponId` has a def and
  every non-pod class has a positive hull.
- ☐ **[S]** *Deferred:* lift sim-only tuning constants (`LaunchSpeed`, `DockRadiusFrac`, pod-eject params)
  into the tuning config *when they need runtime tuning* (folds into Stage 1's YAML).

### Stage 1 — Content pipeline (YAML authoring + per-server override) — ✅ DONE (2026-06-28)

Make all content editable data the server loads, not C# — the substrate for every later def
(weapons, costs, factions, tech, mechanics knobs). Reuses the existing def→`MsgDefs`→client path
(no client change); adds only a server-side loader (`YamlDotNet`).

- ✅ **YAML is the authoritative content** — there is **no compile-in content**: the server reads
  ship/weapon/base/world defs from YAML at boot (`server/Content/ContentLoader` + `ContentSet`,
  `YamlDotNet`), builds the shared def objects, and ships them over `MsgDefs` (no client change).
  `GameContent`/`FlightModel` keep only stable **id constants + the integrator** — the stat *numbers*
  live solely in the YAML bundle. The flight-stat path is single-sourced from the loaded def on BOTH
  sides (`ShipStats.FromDef`; server authority + client `Mass` re-derive route through it), and base
  health + world-scale seed from the content too, so a YAML-tuned ship/world can't desync.
- ✅ **Default location + per-server override** — the server loads `content/stock.yaml` (shipped next
  to the binary, resolved via `AppContext.BaseDirectory`) by default; `--content PATH` / `CONTENT_PATH`
  overrides the **location** with a different complete bundle (mirrors the `--secret`/`SIM_SECRET`
  pattern). An operator retunes mechanics or adds content per server by editing/copying the YAML —
  **no recompile**, **no client patch** (content reusing existing assets; new visual assets need
  asset streaming, Stage 4).
- ✅ **Schema + validation** — `ContentValidator` (shared) fails fast at boot on a malformed/incomplete
  bundle (dangling weapon-hardpoint refs, non-positive non-pod hull, dup ids, no base def) with a
  clear error and a refuse-to-start (the client has no fallback). `tests/ContentTest` loads the bundle,
  validates it, spot-checks the loader, and asserts deterministic wire defs; `tests/FlightModelTest`
  is now a pure flight-model determinism guard (its golden uses inline stat fixtures).
- ✅ **PIVOT — adopt `Allegiance.Factions` as the canonical content model** *(DONE 2026-06-28)*. The
  bespoke v1 `ContentLoader`/`ContentSet`/`ContentValidator` is gone; the in-repo
  `Allegiance.Factions` library (`factions/`) is now the **source of the configuration mechanism
  itself**. The server boots from the factions bundle and projects it into the unchanged `MsgDefs`
  wire path — in-game ships/weapons/base are byte-identical to pre-pivot and the **client is
  untouched**. Concretely:
  - ✅ **Author content as a factions `Core` bundle** — the single `stock.yaml` is replaced by a
    manifest split under `server/content/core/` (shared catalog fragments + `factions/stock.yaml`)
    with the library's checked-in **JSON schemas** for editor validation/autocomplete. The schemas are
    regenerated from the model via the library CLI.
  - ✅ **Load + validate with the library's own machinery** — `ContentLoader` now calls
    `CoreSerializer.Load` + `CoreValidator.Validate` (referential integrity, refuse-to-start on
    error), then runs the existing shared `ContentValidator` on the projected defs as a second gate.
  - ✅ **Project `Core` → runtime defs** — `server/Content/FactionsContentProjection.cs` maps
    `Hull`/`Weapon`/`Station` buildables (+ world config) onto the existing
    `ShipClassDef`/`WeaponDef`/`BaseDef`/`WorldConfig` records, so the **wire path and determinism
    contract are unchanged**. The runtime-only data the records need — **hardpoint geometry, the 13
    flight f32s, stable byte ids, tick-domain ballistics** — is carried by optional omit-when-default
    fields added to the `Hull`/`Weapon`/`Station` model + a `Core`-level world-config record (the
    library's 16 tests stay green; `sample-data` is unaffected).
  - ✅ **One data layer, no second migration** — the same `Core` now feeds Stage 2's unlock gating
    (`TechSet`/`Capability` forward-closure) below, and is ready for Stage 4's tech tree + factions,
    rather than a parallel def schema that would later need reconciling.

### Stage 2 — Thin strategy spine — ✅ DONE (2026-06-28)

Cheap foundations that unblock economy, buying, and gating. Costs/unlocks are authored in the
Stage-1 YAML. Build minimally; enrich in Stage 4.

- ✅ **Per-team shared state** — a per-team `TeamState` container in `server/Sim/World.cs` (keyed by
  team byte, parallel to base health) homing `Credits`, `OwnedTechs`/`OwnedCapabilities` (seeded from
  the stock faction's `BaseTechs`/`BaseCapabilities`), and `Score`.
- ✅ **Team credits + flat paycheck** — a per-team balance that accrues on a fixed tick cadence
  (`Faction.BonusMoney` at start + `Faction.IncomeMoney` rate), driven from the sim step. The simplest
  "money"; the real mining economy replaces the income source in Stage 4.
- ✅ **Per-team unlock-set (def gating hook)** — spawns are gated by the `Core` model's
  **`TechSet`/`Capability` forward-closure** via `BuildableResolver.GetBuildables(core, ownedTechs,
  ownedCapabilities)` (no ad-hoc `UnlockId`). The tech tree's *enforcement* mechanism, in place before
  the tree UI exists.
- ✅ **Server spawn-cost enforcement** — the `EnqueueJoin → ProcessRespawns → SpawnCombatShip` path
  rejects a spawn whose hull is locked or unaffordable and deducts `Cost` on success
  (server-authoritative); the client's pre-check (`WorldRenderer.CheckSpawnGate`) suppresses doomed
  buys and surfaces the reason without hanging `_spawnPending`.
- ✅ **Wire: per-team state + ship cost** — proto bumped 9→10; `ShipClassDef.Cost` rides `MsgDefs`,
  and a low-rate `MsgTeamState` carries per-team `Credits`/`Score` + the unlocked-class snapshot to
  the client (`WorldRenderer.NetUpdateTeamState`).
- ✅ **Buy menu** — the in-match spawn menu (`client/scripts/Hud.cs`) is now def-driven
  (`DefRegistry.BuildableShips`): one button per hull showing `Spawn <name> — <cost> credits`, grayed
  out when unaffordable or locked, with a running team-credits readout. Reuses `Lobby.MakeButton()`.
- ✅ **Authority: bootstrap-simple** — any-player-spends / auto; **no commander yet** (Stage 4).

### Stage 3 — Combat feel & depth

Richer dogfighting on shipped systems. Content authored after Stage 2 is **priced + gated by
construction** (and YAML-defined per Stage 1) — missiles land into the Stage-0 seam and the
Stage-2 economy, no rework.

- ✅ **Escape pods** — ships eject a pod on death; the pod must die or be rescued by a teammate
  before the player respawns.
- ✅ **Booster / smoke-trail FX** — booster smoke trail reacting to thrust.
- ✅ **Missiles** — guided missiles shipped (2026-07-02, proto 15): `WeaponKind.Missile` launchers
  authored as factions `Launcher`+`Missile` YAML (turn rate/accel/speed/lock/damage/trail all
  data), hung on fighter/bomber hardpoints; server-authoritative lock + `MissileSim` pursuit
  streamed via `MsgMissiles`/`MsgMissileGone`; finite racks; lock/ammo/incoming-warning HUD with
  original Allegiance models+SFX; PIGs fire them; `tests/MissileTest` determinism guard.
  Completed 2026-07-03 (proto 18): **chaff** (`WeaponKind.Chaff` decoy-dispenser YAML; drop with
  `C`; deterministic pure-hash decoy roll vs authored `chaff-resistance` at the `TryChaffAim`
  seam; `MsgChaff` puffs), blast-radius splash (`ApplyBlast` + client `CreateBlast` VFX scaled by
  `blast-radius`), pre-launch "being locked" warning (ship-record threat flags → amber/red HUD
  banner + original lock tone), rearm at base (voluntary dock refunds the ship's `PaidCost`;
  dock→relaunch = free full rearm+repair; death refunds nothing). *Deferred: PIG auto-chaff.*
- ✅ **Mines & fields** — shipped 2026-07-03 (proto 18): `WeaponKind.Mine` mine-dispenser
  authored as factions `Launcher`+`Mine` YAML (trigger/power/blast/cloud radius+count/arm-delay/
  lifespan all data); `B` deploys a seed-based pseudo-random field (`shared/MinefieldLayout`,
  ≤64 mines, `aliveMask`) streamed via `MsgMinefields`/`MsgMineGone` for the anchor sector; mines
  arm after a delay, trigger per-mine on enemy proximity (grid-cube scan), splash via
  `ApplyBlast`, and the field depletes gradually; team-tinted billboard sprites client-side;
  default hold authored per hull (`default-cargo`, payload-costed, hangar steppers live via
  `MsgSpawn` cargo). `tests/MineTest` determinism guard. *Deferred: mine-vs-mine chains,
  shootable mines, PIG mine-laying.*
- ✅ **Shields & damage systems** — shipped (proto 19): a regenerating energy **shield** authored
  per hull/faction in YAML (`shield-capacity`/`shield-recharge`/`shield-delay` on `Hull`;
  Fighter/Bomber carry one, Scout/Pod don't) layered over the raw-health model. One central
  `Simulation.ApplyDamage` seam routes **all** damage (bolts, missiles, blast, mines, collisions,
  boundary) through the shield first: it absorbs while it holds (hull untouched) and overflow spills
  to hull when a hit pops it; recharge resumes after a per-hull quiet delay. The **damage-type
  interaction** is a per-weapon `shield-damage-multiplier` (default 1.0; the bomber cannon authors
  0.5 = half vs shields). Current shield rides the snapshot; the client draws a cyan **SHLD** solid
  arc wrapping the HULL gauge (`SystemRing`, completing the Claude Design "Game HUD" ring), plays a
  distinct `shield_hit.ogg` + a hemisphere `ShieldFlash` when a bolt strikes a raised shield vs a
  bare hull. `tests/ShieldTest` guards absorb/spillover/recharge/multiplier; a `Simulation.ShieldsEnabled`
  toggle lets the missile/mine damage tests isolate raw damage.
- ✅ **Boost recharge & ship-class feel** — boost limit + recharge; some classes recharge, some
  don't. (FX done; the recharge *mechanic* is not.)
- ✅ **Adaptive prediction lead** — lead derived from measured RTT + jitter (`UpdateAdaptiveLead`);
  `STDB_LEAD` (legacy name) remains as a manual override.
- ✅ **[M]** **Alephs block shots**  - from weapons and missiles
  - Alephs should act as physical barriers that prevent projectiles from passing through them, requiring
    players to navigate around or otherwise account for their presence in combat scenarios.
- ✅ **[M]** **Control settings and mappings** — shipped (2026-07-09): flight/combat/scope controls
  migrated onto Godot InputMap actions (`client/scripts/InputBindings.cs` — defaults single-sourced
  in C#, registered at boot in `SfxManager._Ready`, overrides persisted in `UserPrefs` `[bindings]`).
  Rebindable from Settings → Controls (grouped `KeybindRow` list, click-to-capture key/mouse/**gamepad**,
  RESTORE DEFAULTS + revert), with analog joystick support via `Input.GetAxis`. Menu/system keys
  (Esc, F3/F4/F9, base-select/spawn digits, chat) stay hardcoded to protect the modal input-gating.
  *Deferred: named preset schemes (Default/Southpaw), rebinding the menu/system keys.*
- ✅ **[L]** **Ship autopilot and navigation** — shipped 2026-07-10 (protocol v30): players get
  the PIG-style navigation PIGs already had. Pick a target (Tab now cycles ships → bases →
  asteroids in view; F3 map left-click selects an entity or drops a grid-plane **waypoint**,
  right-click engages), press **T** (new rebindable `engage_autopilot`) and the ship flies
  itself. Steering is **server-side**, synthesized at the existing `InputFor()` seam via the
  shared `AutoSteer` (verbatim extraction of the PIG steer/attack bodies, determinism-guarded by
  the PIG suites): approach + brake-to-standoff on waypoints/rocks/enemy bases, keep-station
  (never auto-fires) on enemy ships, fly-to-door auto-dock on a friendly base, single-hop aleph
  transit cross-sector; arrival/dock/death/target-loss or any real manual stick input disengages
  (cruise-control handback). New `MsgSetAutopilot=11` carries the target; `ShipFlagAutopilot=16`
  echoes the engaged state back. Client uses **follow-authority prediction**: while engaged it
  suspends own-ship `Step()` and eases the render onto authoritative snapshots through the
  reconcile spring (chase cam stays smooth, `ReconcileCount` doesn't climb), re-anchoring C¹ on
  entry/exit; it keeps sampling+sending real sticks so the server detects override. AUTOPILOT HUD
  banner + disengage toast (`DesignTokens` cyan chrome); friendly-base focus now draws its TARGET
  bracket (never a lock arc). `tests/AutopilotTest` covers approach/standoff/stop/aleph/avoidance/
  override/friendly-dock/target-loss. *Deferred: multi-hop aleph routing, enemy-ghost tracking
  through fog, reuse for miners/constructors.* 
  - Make it so tab can select other types of targets (e.g., bases, asteroids), prioritize in-view enemy ships, then enemy bases, then cycle through other targets (e.g., asteroids) in view.
  - Make it so targets can be selected with the mouse from the F3 screen.
  - Abstract the PIG autopilot/autosteer behavior so that it can be reused for player ships, allowing them to follow waypoints or targets with similar logic.
  - We will eventually (out of scope) want to be able to attach this autopilot behavior to other entities, such as miners and constructors (that fly to asteroids to make bases)
  - Press 'T' (new mappable control) to engage the autopilot towards the selected target or waypoint.
- Turrets: Allow players to mount turret endpoints while a ship that supports turret hardpoints is in-base ('load up' the turrets)
  - Once launched, the player will 'ride along' with the pilot, able to control a gun from the turret's hardpoint, aiming it and firing it
- Ripcord: Allows specific types of ships (with the ability) to jump to a specific location in a sector after a brief, configurable, delay
  - When player picks the sector to teleport to, the ship will pick a ripcordable device (either a probe or a teleport base) in that sector
  - The player yields control of the ship, and is exposed/vulnerable to damage for a length of time that is based on yaml config + configurable target multiplier (i.e. probes take longer to ripcord to, potentially)
  - As the ship is preparing to ripcord, it should display a visual countdown, and very slowly list/spin in a circle until the countdown reaches zero, then the ship is instantly transported.
  - If the player interrupts the autopilot-ripcord (thrust, fire, steer etc), control is yielded back and the countdown cancels
  - Show a visual flash as the user leaves and enters the sector via teleport/ripcord
- **[M]** **Mini-preview of target** — Display information about the currently selected target in a compact HUD element, including health, type, and distance. This allows players to quickly assess threats and opportunities without opening the full F3 map. We should also show it in the F3 map.
- Add different gun effects
  - i.e. minigun green, different looking bolt
  - ER nanite shoots glowing blue, thin, toruses

### Stage 4 — Strategy depth (Allegiance core)

The economic + RTS loop. Largely sequential; each item builds on Stage 2's money + gating and the
Stage-1 YAML pipeline.

- ✅ **Fog of war** — shipped (proto 23): server-authoritative **per-team shared vision**. Statics
  (asteroids, bases, alephs) stay hidden until a teammate scouts them, then persist as team memory —
  a base destroyed while unseen keeps its last-known health (`LastKnownBaseHealth`) until re-scouted.
  Enemy ships are streamed only while in a teammate's sight; once radar-seen and then lost they
  persist as last-known **ghost** contacts (HUD/F3 glyph only, never a 3D mesh) until re-scouted empty
  or re-spotted. Vision is per-hull YAML (long-range **cone** + omni proximity **sphere**, scouts get
  much bigger values; asteroids occlude the cone via the bolt raycast); **bases** contribute an
  unoccluded vision sphere (garrison watches from tick 0); every target carries a **radar signature**
  multiplier scaling all detection ranges (small scouts seen closer, bombers/bases farther). An outer
  **eyeball tier** (`fog-eyeball-multiplier`, ~1.5× sphere) streams an enemy's mesh in-world while its
  radar/HUD/targeting stay silent — a keen-eyed player can spot a stealth fleet before radar. Deployable
  **recon probes** (`WeaponKind.Probe` launcher + expendable, model `acs64`) add team vision spheres.
  Vision is computed on a **dedicated 2 Hz worker thread** (snapshot-in / apply-at-boundary pipeline,
  `Simulation.Vision.cs`) so the sim tick is untouched; wire frames `MsgReveal`/`MsgContacts` (ghosts +
  radar-id list) / `MsgProbes`/`MsgProbeGone` + `MsgShipGone reason=2` (quiet fade), all per-team,
  reusing Welcome's static encoders so they can't drift. PIGs and missile-lock respect team vision (no
  more wallhack). World-YAML `fog-of-war` (default on) toggles it; **off = bytes/behavior identical to
  pre-fog** (single shared coarse buffer, no worker, full Welcome). `tests/FogTest` covers cone/sphere/
  occlusion/signature/eyeball/ghost-lifecycle/base-vision/probe/determinism. *Deferred: shootable
  probes (combat fields dormant), PIG auto-probe usage, `MsgMissiles` team-filtering (accepted
  incoming-warning leak), vision-cone HUD rendering, eyeball-tier occlusion (unoccluded in v1).*
- ✅ **[M]** **Commander** — shipped (proto 34): explicit per-team commander STATE in the
  connection-layer `Lobby` (seeded to the first pilot to join the side, falls to the next-lowest
  client id on leave/drop, manually reassignable via `/commander <name>` by the sitting commander
  or the host — so it can't be purely derived). Streamed on the `MsgLobbyState` tail
  (`commander0/commander1`); client exposes `CommanderIdOf`/`IsCommander` and renders a gold
  **CMDR badge** in the lobby roster. The commander is the single AI authority: `/mine` and
  `/buyminer` are now commander-gated (`ClientHub.CommanderOrWarn` — closes the mining deferred
  item). **No accounts required.** `tests/LobbyTest` covers seed/fall-through/manual-set.
  *Deferred: lobby "MAKE CMDR" button (chat command only), commander persistence across reconnect
  (rank falls to next senior; re-promote manually).*
- ✅ **[L]** **Commander orders / F3 select-and-command** — shipped (proto 34): left-click on the
  F3 map SELECTS any entity (friendly/enemy ship, base, rock — new `SectorOverview.SelectedId`,
  separate from Tab focus; click-away deselects; gold brackets = commandable friendly ship). With
  a friendly ship selected, right-click sends **`MsgOrder`** naming the clicked target; the server
  infers the verb (enemy ship → attack, enemy base → attack/`AttackPoint`, anything else → go to
  and idle near; right-click the selected ship itself = release to autonomy). **Anyone may issue
  orders; AI obeys only the commander's** (hub-gated) — orders to a HUMAN teammate relay as a
  gold team-chat directive (`MsgChatRelay` scope 2) instead. AI orders live in
  `Simulation.Orders.cs` (`_pigOrders` keyed by ShipId) and are consumed by `TryObeyOrder`, a
  top-priority goal in the `PigDecide` chain (below rescue) emitting only existing plan kinds —
  orders complete-and-revert (target dies / radar contact lost under fog / base destroyed), and a
  holding pig defends its point. Miner subjects map onto mining state (rock order pins the claim +
  authorizes the sector; point = per-miner `/mine`; friendly base = pinned offload).
  `tests/CommanderTest` (9 scenarios). *Deferred: multi-select / order queueing, order markers on
  the F3 map, PIG order-status HUD.*
- ✅ **[M]** **Maps** — shipped (2026-07-10): base/asteroid/aleph positions reshuffle every match
  (fresh random seed per match start, even on the same map), so players explore instead of
  memorizing. Layouts were already fully seed-generated; the seed is now random by default and
  pinnable via `SIM_SEED` / `--seed N` for exact repro (each rolled match seed is logged).
- ✅ **[XL]** **Mining + economy** — DONE (2026-07-11, `mining` branch): rock classes (He3 harvestable,
  volume-proportional shrink streamed via `MsgRockUpdate`), per-team AI miner drones
  (`Simulation.Mining.cs`, purchasable via `/buyminer`, sector orders via `/mine <sector>`, status via
  `/miners`), multi-hop aleph routing (`World.NextGateTo`, players get multi-hop autopilot free),
  offload → team credits alongside the flat paycheck. `tests/MiningTest` + pinned-seed layout golden.
  *Deferred:* build queues, commander-gated authority, refinery uses for uranium/silicon/carbonaceous,
  shrunk-rock vision occlusion / PIG avoidance (stay at spawn radius).
  - Create classes of rock that asteroids should be categorized into (e.g., helium-3, uranium, silicon, and carbonaceous).
  - Each team starts with 1 miner, but can purchase up to 4 at a time (configurable max in world yaml)
  - Miners harvest only from helium-3 asteroids
  - Miners, once launched, will auto-pilot to the nearest helium-3 asteroid that is
    - a. Not already targeted by another miner, unless there are more miners than asteroids
    - b. Not depleted
    - c. Was already 'working on' before filling
  - Once miner is filled, it will return to the nearest base to offload the harvested resources, then after a brief delay, relaunch to harvest again, either the same rock, or if it is depleted, the next eligible helium-3 asteroid according to the rules above.
  - If the nearest base is not in the same sector, the miner will navigate to the base across sectors, potentially taking longer to offload resources before resuming harvesting.
  - A miner will not enter a new sector to mine unless the commander tells him to go to that sector to mine (at least once)
- ✅ **[L]** **Tech paths** — shipped 2026-07-14 (proto 36, `tech-tree` branch; handoffs in
  `.PLAN/tech-paths/PHASE-{A,B,C,D}-HANDOFF.md`). The docked screen is a real three-tab shell
  (**HANGAR / BUILD / RESEARCH**) over a shared **CommandSidebar** (SectorMapPreview command map +
  "Your Bases" with live research banners); the hangar's ship picker is a horizontal card strip and
  the sidebar's launch-base pick is REAL (MsgSpawn carries the base id, server validates+falls back).
  Research is YAML-authored `Development`s (price + `build-time-seconds` + required/granted techs —
  the existing factions Core model; NEW `obsoleted-by-techs` field for future tier replacement +
  `research-slots` per station), streamed as a full catalog in MsgDefs; a **commander** authorizes
  at a base (`MsgResearch`, or `/research <id>` chat) — per-base **slots + one on-deck queue**
  (deduct at start AND at queue-reservation; cancel = 100% refund; dead base = loss); completion
  grants techs/caps and re-resolves unlocks **mid-match** (`Simulation.Research.cs`; per-team
  `MsgResearchState`, startTick+duration encoded). Stock tree gates the **bomber** behind
  `heavy-ordnance` and a new **heavy-cannon** behind `cannon-tier-2` (2026-07-18: unresearched
  items are HIDDEN outright in the hangar/build UI — no greyed `⚿ LOCKED` rows/cards; research
  makes them appear). The BUILD tab renders the 7 future station types from YAML as
  placeholders (real gating states, purchase disabled until base building). `tests/StrategyTest`
  research suite + ContentTest catalog checks. *Deferred: stat-modifier developments
  (AttributeModifiers), per-site base types for slots, authored obsoleted-by content, hull unlock
  chips (ShipClassDef has no wire tech refs).*
- ◐ **[XL]** **Base building + constructors** — MVP shipped 2026-07-14 (proto 37): the **Outpost** is
  buildable end-to-end; the other station types are one YAML edit away (see below). Bases are now
  **per-type data** like ship hulls — `BaseDef.ModelName` selects the GLB (server collision + client
  mesh, mirroring `ShipClassDef`), `BaseSite.BaseTypeId` rides the wire, and `World.CreateBase`
  appends a base at runtime (growable `BaseHealth`/`ResearchByBase`, index-parallel). A **constructor**
  is an AI drone (`ShipKind.Constructor`, `Simulation.Constructors.cs`) modeled on the miner: bought
  from the docked **Build tab** bound to a station type (commander-gated `MsgBuildConstructor`, charges
  the station price), launched from a **garrison** (win-condition base) only, F3-ordered to a
  compatible rock (reuses the miner order plumbing; stock outpost → **Regolith**), then it navigates,
  aligns, **sinks** into the rock, and a spinning greenish-blue **build sphere** (`BuildSphere.cs`,
  streamed via `MsgConstructorBuilds`) envelops the asteroid over the station's `build-time-seconds`
  before the base appears fully constructed (reveals via the fog log / a fog-off broadcast) and grants
  its capabilities. **Win condition reworked**: a per-type `WinCondition` flag (= the `start` ability,
  garrison-only) — a team loses only when ALL its win-condition bases die, so a destroyed outpost never
  ends the match. `tests/ConstructorTest` covers the full loop + the rock-class gate + win-condition.
  *Deferred:* docking/repair/rearm at outposts (no dock faces on Outpost.glb — sphere/convex collision
  only); the 6 other station types (add `base-type-id` + `model-name` + `build-on-rock-class` to
  `stations.yaml` — no code); cap-revoke when a granting base is destroyed (grants are additive for the
  match); CommandSidebar build banner; per-site research slots; live visual sign-off of the sphere.
  - ✅ Generalize bases so the mesh is YAML config (`model-name`), like ship hulls — not hardcoded.
  - ◐ Multiple base types by YAML (Garrison + Outpost live; Shipyard/Supremacy/Tactical-Lab/Expansion/
    Teleport-Receiver/Refinery are authored placeholders, buildable via YAML). Bases grant caps/tech.
  - ✅ Commander buys constructors from the docked Build tab (miners stay on `/buyminer`).
  - ✅ Constructors are AI drones (`utl11.glb`, not hardcoded), launch from a garrison, buildable rock
    class configurable per base type.
  - ✅ Ordered to a compatible asteroid → navigate → standoff → align (configurable) → sink in.
  - ✅ Spinning greenish/blue translucent multi-layer sphere envelops the asteroid over a configurable
    time; the constructor mesh vanishes (server despawns it at completion, sphere covers it).
  - ✅ Base appears fully constructed on the asteroid; build effect removed; tech paths unlocked.
- ✅ **[L]** **Allegiance Stub tech tree**  — Take a thin slice of the allegiance tech tree by implementing SOME of iron coalitions ships, bases, weapons, research etc
  - Ships: 
    - Starting: Scout, Lt Interceptor
    - Supremacy Center: Enh. Fighter and Adv. Fighter upgrades
    - Basic: Bomber (Must research before launching)
    - Shipyard: Devastator
  - Weapons: 
    - Gatling Gun (1, 2, and 3), (for scouts, fighters, and bombers)
    - Nanite (inverse damage)
    - Mini-Gun (for interceptors)
  - Bases:
    - Garrison -> Starbase
    - Outpost -> Heavy Outpost (each has to be upgraded?)
    - Supremacy Center -> Adv. Supremacy Center
    - Shipyard
- ☐ **[L]** Update plan to include multiple teams; each map only supports a certain number of teams, so this is a constraint that must be reflected in the plan. Plan should include a richer 'game lobby' (as opposed to server lobby) experience; allowing users to select or join teams before the match starts. First person on a perspective team (and not on NOAT/not on a team) can configure the number of teams (2-6 for now).
- ☐ **[XL]** **Runtime asset streaming (client-patchless content)** — the client downloads meshes/textures/
  audio it lacks from the game server into a temp cache, so a server can define an entire faction
  (or new ship/weapon) that clients render **without installing a patch**. Defs already stream
  (`MsgDefs`); this extends the same model to binary assets (transfer + cache + load-from-temp +
  validation/eviction). A substantial sub-project — the enabler for fully server-authored factions.
  - **On-join loading gate.** Asset transfer is an explicit **blocking phase behind a loading
    screen**, completed *before* the 20 Hz state stream starts — so bulk bytes never compete with
    realtime gameplay on the single reliable-ordered channel (WS or WebRTC alike), and no second
    data channel / CDN is required. A bad or missing asset fails at the loading screen with a clear
    error (the client has no compile-time fallback), never mid-match.
  - **Content-hash manifest + resumable cache.** Server is authoritative over a hashed manifest
    (`assetId → {sha256, size, optional httpUrl}`) streamed over the existing def path; the temp
    cache is keyed by content hash so a rejoining client re-pulls only what changed. The optional
    per-asset `httpUrl` lets a high-scale operator offload fanout to a bucket/CDN without making one
    a requirement.
  - **Client ships a seed cache (not a baked-in fallback).** The client bundles the stock-faction
    assets at install, pre-populating the hash-keyed cache so a vanilla first-join downloads ~nothing.
    This is *not* the forbidden "baked-in" pattern: bundled assets are only ever used when the
    server manifest names their exact `sha256` — a different/updated server asset has a different
    hash and streams normally. So the server stays authoritative over content (binary-asset analog
    of the no-baked-tuning rule: defs are authority data with no fallback; assets are content-
    addressed blobs validated against server-named hashes, safe to pre-ship).
- ☐ **[L]** **Factions** — distinct factions with unique ship classes, tech trees, and visual styles for
  asymmetric play (a faction dimension on YAML defs). *Faction rules ride Stage 1; faction assets
  ride asset streaming above.*

### Stage 5 — Social & persistence (independent track)

Orthogonal to the strategy loop, which runs on ephemeral per-match state. Do when persistence is
wanted. **The discovery + hosting core is done; the social/persistence layer is not.**

- ✅ **Public lobby & discovery** — `public-lobby/` registry + WebRTC signaling relay; direct-first
  reachability probing, WebRTC/STUN fallback (no TURN), Railway deploy.
- ✅ **Server lifecycle** — empty-server idle reset + match recycling; protocol versioning;
  client-update release checks that ban out-of-date servers/clients.
- ☐ **[M]** **Spectator mode** — follow players with Tab (camera orbits target); pick sectors from the
  lobby.
- ☐ **[M]** **Scores, kills/deaths & ranks** — *durable* per-player post-match stats, an overall point
  system, and player ranks. (In-match scoreboards are Stage 3.)
- ☐ **[XL]** **Matchmaking, accounts & persistence** — player identities/auth, ELO, match history. Lobby
  owns the persistent storage; deployed as part of the lobby project. Use **Orleans** so the lobby
  is horizontally scalable and manages state. (BIG)
- ☐ **[L]** **Client authentication** — clients prove identity to the lobby (per-session secrets/tokens).
  Choose a provider that supports **passkeys**; lobby issues a session secret per client, validated
  by game servers (JWT?).
- ☐ **[M]** **Game-server authentication** — game servers prove identity to the lobby; on start, show a
  link in the terminal to authenticate the session. Same userbase as clients.

### Cross-cutting / opportunistic

Not stage-bound — done when convenient or when a stage needs them.

- ✅ **CI / automated testing** — tag-triggered Release workflow (client zips + GHCR server image);
  `FlightModelTest` (determinism/golden + content guard) and `CryptoTest` in `tests/`.
- ☐ **[S]** **Improve asteroid texture mapping** — reduce stretching via better UVs or tri-planar mapping;
  explore baking and in-engine parallax/height maps.
- ◐ **[S]** **Spatial audio polish** — `SfxManager` exists; ✅ collision thuds (asteroids AND bases,
  client-side interception in `WorldRenderer.CheckCollisions` against the shared convex hulls, with
  the own-base dock-disc carve-out) and ✅ a volume settings UI (per-bus sliders in the Lobby
  overlay, persisted via `UserPrefs`) shipped. Remaining: finer mix tuning / more event coverage.

## Deep backlog

- ☐ **[L]** **Replay system** — tick log or time-travel query playback.
- ☐ **[M]** **Fireteam support** — sub-teams of 2-6 players that can privately chat. Commanders can
  assign players to fireteams and issue orders to specific fireteams.
- ☐ **[M]** **Mutinees** — A player can stage a mutiny on a team, all other players (except commander) can vote to depose the commander; if the vote passes, the mutineer becomes the new commander.
- ☐ **[L]** **Ship salvage & pickups** — destroyed ships drop expendables (ammo / booster fuel / guns / missiles / mines)
  to fly over and collect; ties into the Stage-2 economy.
  - When a ship is destroyed, there should be a chance that it drops whatever expendable or weapon that was equipped/not consumed, flying out in a random direction until it comes to rest.
  - Meshes for various dropped items should match GLB visual representation, or if none are available, pick an asset from the pick-assets folder. Ask me for each missing asset.
  - The dropped item should be able to be picked up by a ship flying over it, if the ship has the capacity to carry it.
  - If the ship does not have capacity, the item can bounce off harmlessly.
  - If the item is in-motion, it should collision detect with asteroids and bases
